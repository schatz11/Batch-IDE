Why another program for editing batch files?

When i first started to learn batch, i used the standard text editing tool windows notepad for creating and editing batch files, and i felt the need of a program which i can use to simplify my work with batch files. When i mastered batch scripting, i learned object-oriented computer programming language. i realized that it was fairly easy to create a basic batch-scripter using VB. i started to look for an existing solution for the task but i was not able to find anything; After that i decided to develop my own scripter for batch scripting. and that's how "Batch IDE" was born.
